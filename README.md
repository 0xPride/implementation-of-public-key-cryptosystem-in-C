## Simple implementation of  public-key cryptosystem, based of RSA algorithme.
there is three programes, the first generate the Keys and the second crypte a message and the last decrypte it .

To compile the three programes : Run the commande [make all]

To crypt a message , write it in a file then Run this commande using the message file and the shosen public_key : [./crypt message_file key_file]

To decrypt a message , Run this commande using the crypted file and the shosen privat key : [./decrypt message_file key_file]

## the Key programme :
the key programme generate 3 numbers (e and n and d), represent them in two files of size 16 bytes, key_rsa and key_rsa.pub , key_rsa containe d and n (private key), key_rsa.pub containe e and n (public key).

How i did it ?

I generate two prime number of 5 digits using Rand function and change the argument seed using Srand function with time as parametre , so every second the rand generate a different number.

then calculate [n = p * q] and [f = (p - 1)*(q - 1)]

e is coprime with f . To find e and d i initialize e with max(p,q) , why max(p,q)? to stay in the same range and keep it hard to reverse. I iterate e tel GCD(e,f) = 1 and d > 0,  using Extended Euclidean algorithm.

finally lets prepare the keys, public key file (16bytes) containe e and n [8bytes = e][8bytes = n],

                              privat key file (16bytes) containe d and n [8bytes = d][8bytes = n].

## crypt and decrypt programmes : 
lets say me and Aimad we want to start a conversation , first we need to generate our keys then send our public key to each other. 
Now Aimad open a file using text editeur and write a message and crypt it using my public key and send it to me.

I receive it and decrypt it using my own private key.

m is the bytes range of n in this example . 257 byte range is 2 because he occupate and can be stored in 2 bytes .

how Aimad crypt the message? , first gets e and n from my public key file, , i read the message from the end and get the value of every m - 1 bytes , and calculate the value power of e modulo[n], and storet in m bytes in the encrypted message.

[m - 1 bytes of the message] -----------> [m bytes of the crypted message]

why exactly m - 1 bytes become m bytes? because the result of the calculation give as a number of range of n whitch is m .

i get d and n from my privat key file . and start decrypting it, i read read the crypted message from the end and get the value of every m bytes, and calculate the value power of d modulo n, and storet in m - 1 bytes in the decrypted message .

[m bytes of the crypted message] -----------> [m - 1 bytes of the decrypted message]

the calculation give as a number of range n (m bytes) so why we can storet in m - 1 bytes? because the decryption give as the original value that can be stored in m - 1.
